Run Majority Model, w/ some initial colouring and graph, returns # of black ndoes/how long it took at some point of convergence (static or blinking). - Done

New graph at each iteration. - Donwe

Implement adversary at the beginning. 

Adversary has a set of tools and an objective. Each has a real world similarity.

Tool: Change node colour
Tool: Add fake Node
Tool: Add/remove edge


Simple Objective: Wants one colour to win
Complex Objective: Create disagreement, different ends of edges have different opinions
Complex Objective: Wants a polarised society.


Two set ups:
#1: Budget k, can change colour of k nodes
#2: Budget k, modify k edges


Want to study the influence of the adversary, 

x-axis: k budget y-axis: number of white nodes
Run 5 times to get the data

Think different strategies, to make adversary as smart as possible.

NEED: A diagram, each with different strategies 


Two Comments:
1. Shifted towards experiment, still try to get the theoretical side

2. Hardness result, massage it for future results.
